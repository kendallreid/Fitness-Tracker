## What's New (User Facing)
* Database Integration
* LogIn
* Registration
* HomePage
## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint, we concentrated on integrating the database into our backend in order to have communication between the frontend and backend involving user functionality. We built out features for login, registration, and homepage by creating database models first, then connecting them to API routes, and tested with the frontend last. A large barrier to work through was managing authentication flows and redirects properly, especially moving from registration to login. Another important lesson was that we need to version-control our database files too and align our Git workflow to not have the build conflicts during database development and setup. Overall, this sprint increased our comprehension of the full-stack integration while increasing collaborative debugging issues between layers of the full-stack application.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* Item 1: We created a very solid foundation
* Item 2: We showed that we were able to handle issues efficiently, we were able to accomplish what we set out to do in a more limited amount of time
* Item 3: 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Item 1: Organization, each issue should be assigned to exactly 1 person and have a corresponding branch
* Item 2: Planning, we need to make sure that we have the resources that we need before we start working on an issue. This way we can avoid things like multiple definitions for the same thing. Making our code look more cohesive is a goal for us.
* Item x
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Item 1: Having a designated home page
* Item 2: Workout/Calorie Tracking 
* Item 3: Personalization
