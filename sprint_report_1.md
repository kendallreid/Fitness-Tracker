* HomePage
## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint, we concentrated on integrating the database into our backend in order to have communication between the frontend and backend involving user functionality. We built out features for login, registration, and homepage by creating database models first, then connecting them to API routes, and tested with the frontend last. A large barrier to work through was managing authentication flows and redirects properly, especially moving from registration to login. Another important lesson was that we need to version-control our database files too and align our Git workflow to not have the build conflicts during database development and setup. Overall, this sprint increased our comprehension of the full-stack integration while increasing collaborative debugging issues between layers of the full-stack application.
