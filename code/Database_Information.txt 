Helpful Notes for using SQLite3:

Installation: I'm using Ubuntu, if you're using Windows I would look up a tutorial.
Ubuntu Commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3

The structure of what a login/register query would look like:

Login: For login we have 2 options that we could use

(1)
We use a query to check the values of username and password in the table

create a prepared statement (look up syntax, sqlite3_prepare_v2())
- make sure that any inputted values are replaced with a ? in the prepared statement 
bind the inputted values (look up syntax, sql_bind_text())
- this replaces the ? in the prepared statement with the user-inputted values

Then use sqlite3_step(statement)
- this executes the query, then returns a value based on the result.
- look up return types (row, done)

call finalize to free memory that we don't need anymore


(2)
We use a query to obtain the hashed password corresponding to a username, 
then we check if the passwords match in our C++ code

Create prepared statement and bind values like above
- except we only need to bind the username, we will obtain the hashed password

use step to execute the statement
- if successful, use sqlite3_column_text(statement, col) to access the data
- col will be 0 in this case we only obtain 1 value (it's zero indexed)
  if we had a query that wanted to obtain 3 values (a, b, c), col = 0 -> a and so on
- this gives us the password which we will check against the hashed password
